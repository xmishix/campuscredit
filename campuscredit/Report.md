# Blockchain Class — Activity 2

In this repository, I completed **Activity 2** for my blockchain class.

---

## 📌 Overview
The activity focused on building, deploying, and interacting with a custom ERC-20 token using **Hardhat**.  

### Steps Completed
1. **Environment Setup**  
   - Verified Node.js and npm versions.  
   - Initialized a Hardhat JavaScript project.  
   - Installed all necessary dependencies.  

2. **Hardhat Configuration**  
   - Configured Hardhat to support **EIP-1559** transactions.  
   - Enabled meaningful base fees and priority tips for fee analysis.  

3. **ERC-20 Token Development**  
   - Wrote an ERC-20 contract with an `initialSupply`.  
   - Launched a local Hardhat node that generated **20 funded test accounts**.  
   - Deployed the token contract, receiving a contract address on the local network.  

4. **Interaction Scripts**  
   - Transferred tokens between accounts.  
   - Set allowances and approvals.  
   - Experimented with different **priority tips**.  
   - Collected **transaction hashes** and confirmed them in blocks.  

5. **Analysis**  
   - Retrieved and inspected **transaction receipts**.  
   - Analyzed **blocks** and **EIP-1559 fields**.  
   - Decoded raw transaction data for deeper insights.

## ✅ Summary
This activity provided hands-on experience with:
- Writing and deploying ERC-20 contracts.  
- Using **Hardhat scripts** for token transfers and approvals.  
- Experimenting with **EIP-1559 transaction fees**.  
- Analyzing blockchain data (receipts, blocks, decoded payloads).  

It reinforced my understanding of **smart contract deployment, token standards, and gas mechanics** in Ethereum-compatible networks.
